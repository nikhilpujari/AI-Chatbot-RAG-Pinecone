## ‚úÖ RAG Personal Portfolio Chatbot Setup ‚ÄìMake Your Resume Speak

---

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used so the chatbot can fetch real info from your resume before answering, instead of guessing.

Pinecone stores and retrieves your resume data in vector form, making it fast and scalable to search relevant info for each question.
